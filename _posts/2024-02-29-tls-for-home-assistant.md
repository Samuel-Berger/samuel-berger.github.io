# Notes on How I got TLS for Home Assistant

For now more notes than a walkthrough.

## Prerequseites

1. Working installation of Home Assistant OS
2. Domain managed by Digital Ocean (probably works with other providers too)

## Generate an API-key 

Create an [API-key with write scope](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/)
from Digital Ocean.

## Install the [Let's Encrypt Add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/letsencrypt/README.md)

Change the configuration to look something like this:

```yml
domains:
  - homeassistant.<YOURDOMAIN>.com
email: letsencrypt@<YOURDOMAIN>.com
keyfile: privkey.pem
certfile: fullchain.pem
challenge: dns
dns:
  provider: dns-digitalocean
  digitalocean_token: <token generated by Digital Ocean>
```
